# Learning Java

Welcome to **Learning Java**!

This repository is a comprehensive collection of Java learning materials, covering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), and competitive programming problems. Whether you are new to Java or looking to strengthen your programming skills, you'll find helpful resources and practical examples here.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following directories:

### 📚 **Object-Oriented Programming**
Explore fundamental and advanced OOP concepts including:
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Interfaces and Abstract Classes

### 🔢 **DSA-Java**
Data Structures and Algorithms implementations in Java:
- Arrays and Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- And more...

### 🏆 **CodeForce**
Solutions and practice problems from competitive programming platforms like Codeforces.

### 💻 **Projects**
Mini-projects and practical applications demonstrating real-world Java programming:
- Complete applications
- Problem-solving projects
- Integration examples

### 🔧 **NetBeansProjects**
Legacy projects created with NetBeans IDE.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/md-safiulsadik/learning-java.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a specific folder:**
   ```bash
   cd learning-java/DSA-Java
   ```

3. **Open in your favorite Java IDE:**
