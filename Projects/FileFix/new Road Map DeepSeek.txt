   Specialization Track: Generative AI & LLMs  


Your interest aligns perfectly with the industry trend. To specialize:
1.    Master the Transformer Architecture:   This is non--negotiable. Understand encoder vs. decoder architectures.
2.    Become a Hugging Face Power User:   The `transformers`, `datasets`, and `accelerate` libraries are the industry standard.
3.    Learn Retrieval--Augmented Generation (RAG):   This is the most practical and widespread way to build applications with LLMs today, as it grounds them in your own data.
4.    Explore Open--Source Models:   Experiment with models from Meta (Llama 2), Mistral AI, etc. Learn about parameter--efficient fine--tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA.
5.    Understand Prompt Engineering:   Not just for OpenAI's models, but as a fundamental skill for interacting with LLMs.


   Portfolio Building Guidance  


      GitHub is Your Resume:   Every project must be on GitHub.
          README.md is Key:   Every project repo needs a fantastic README with a title, demo GIF/video, project description, tech stack, installation instructions, and usage examples.
          Clean Code:   Write readable, well--commented, and modular code. Use `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` files.
      Blog Your Learnings:   Write short articles on Medium, Dev.to, or your own blog explaining concepts you've mastered. This proves your communication skills and deep understanding.
      Kaggle/Competitions:   Participate in a few competitions. Even a mediocre score shows initiative and familiarity with real--world data problems.


   Career Prep  


      Interview Preparation:  
          Theory:   Be prepared to explain any model or concept on your resume in depth. "What is attention?" "What is overfitting and how do you prevent it?"
          Coding:   LeetCode (focus on Python). Practice implementing ML algorithms from scratch.
          System Design (Crucial for MLE):   Practice designing systems like "How would you build Netflix's recommendation system?" or "Design a service to classify millions of images per second." Study resources like  .
      Networking:  
        Follow researchers and engineers on Twitter/X and LinkedIn.
        Engage with content (comment thoughtfully).
        Attend local ML meetups or conferences (e.g., MLConf).
