Here are the **key takeaways** from the section you shared on the *Hadith of Jibreel* (the hadith of faith, submission, and spiritual excellence):

---

### 1. **Manners of Seeking Knowledge**

  * Show seriousness in learning (even in appearance and conduct).
  * Ask important, meaningful questions — questions are keys to learning.
  * Gabriel (عليه السلام) taught by asking questions, not giving lectures.

### 2. **Three Dimensions of Religion**

* **Iman (Faith):**

  * Faith is both believing in truths and nurturing certainty.
  * Faith must be constantly nourished; without it, religion weakens.
* **Islam (Submission):**

  * The essence of Islam is *willingly accepting to submit to Allah*.
  * Actions (prayer, fasting, zakat, hajj) express this submission but are not the submission itself.
  * A sinful Muslim (not praying, drinking, etc.) is still Muslim if they accept the need to submit.
  * However, sins darken the heart and can eventually endanger faith itself.
* **Ihsan (Spiritual Excellence):**

  * To worship Allah as though you see Him.
  * If not, then at least know that He sees you.
  * Ihsan requires sincerity, striving, and turning to Allah as He commands, in ways most pleasing to Him.

### 3. **Prayer as the Central Support**

* Islam is built on five, but **faith is the foundation**.
* Among the pillars, **prayer is the central support**, like the pole of a tent that holds everything together.

---

### 4. **Danger of Extremes**

* Declaring sinful Muslims as “non-Muslim” is misguidance.
* Sins are dangerous, but repentance is always possible.
* Some religious people, without proper knowledge and guidance, may become arrogant or harsh — a form of delusion.

---

### 5. **Reality of Being True (Ṣidq)**

* Being true means:

  * Your outward actions match your inner claim.
  * Your inner state matches your outward actions.
  * Ṣidq is closely tied to **sincerity (ikhlāṣ)**.
  * Without knowledge and right company, religiosity can become misdirected, leading to self-righteousness or hypocrisy.

---

✅ **In short:**

* Religion has three dimensions: **Faith (Iman)**, **Submission (Islam)**, and **Excellence (Ihsan)**.
* Prayer is the central pillar that sustains religion.
* A Muslim remains Muslim even with sins, but sins threaten faith.
* True spirituality is turning sincerely to Allah in the way He commands, with sincerity, knowledge, and humility.
